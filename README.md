Project Overview
This project implements an Advanced Question Answering (QA) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for intelligent querying of Radio Access Network (RAN) Configuration Management (3GPP XML) and Performance Management (CSV) data. The system is designed to address the complexity of modern telecommunications data by building a Knowledge Graph (KG) from diverse and nested datasets, enabling natural language querying powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The system empowers network engineers to efficiently explore, understand, and analyze RAN data without deep technical querying skills, while ensuring data consistency, cost-effective LLM usage, and schema evolution handling.
